A website made for checking the current weather of a city. It integrates the OpenWeatherAPI and Country Flags API.  
The study reference is from this video: https://youtube.com/watch?v=VS8EBgPwsSU

It will only work with your own Open Weather API key. Create a config.js file inside the js folder, and put you key in this format:

const config = {
  apiKey: "key_here"
}
